Convert curl Commands into k6 Performance Testing Scripts

kurl6 is a CLI tool designed for developers and DevOps engineers to easily convert curl commands into k6 performance testing scripts. With this tool, you can seamlessly transform ad-hoc HTTP requests into full-fledged load testing scripts for k6.

Features

	‚Ä¢	üìú Convert curl commands into reusable k6 scripts.
	‚Ä¢	üñπ Supports multiple requests for testing workflows.
	‚Ä¢	‚ö° Customize virtual users and durations with CLI options.
	‚Ä¢	üõ†Ô∏è Generate scripts only or run tests directly with k6.
	‚Ä¢	üîê Supports authentication headers with tokens.

Installation

Using npm:

npm install -g kurl6

Usage

Basic Conversion:

Convert a simple curl command to a k6 script:

kurl6 "curl -X GET https://example.com" --generate-only

Run Directly with k6:

Execute the generated k6 script with the specified options:

kurl6 "curl -X POST https://example.com -d 'key=value'" --vus=10 --duration=30s

Command-Line Options:

	‚Ä¢	--vus (optional): Number of Virtual Users (default: 10).
	‚Ä¢	--duration (optional): Test duration (default: 30s).
	‚Ä¢	--iterations (optional): Number of iterations.
	‚Ä¢	--generate-only: Output the generated script without running it.
	‚Ä¢	--token (optional): Bearer token for authorization.

Example:

kurl6 "curl -X GET https://api.example.com/data" --vus=50 --duration=1m --token=your-token

How It Works

	1.	Parses the curl command(s) provided as input.
	2.	Converts the HTTP method, URL, headers, and data into a structured k6 script.
	3.	Dynamically generates k6 scenarios for load testing.
	4.	Runs the script or outputs it based on the CLI options.

Generated Script Example

Given the command:

kurl6 "curl -X GET https://example.com -H 'Authorization: Bearer token'"

The tool generates:

import http from "k6/http";
import { sleep } from "k6";

export const options = {
  vus: 10,
  duration: "30s",
};

export default function () {
  const url = "https://example.com";
  const params = { headers: { Authorization: "Bearer token" } };
  http.get(url, params);
  sleep(1);
}
